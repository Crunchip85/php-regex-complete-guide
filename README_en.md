# Regex in PHP: The Complete Guide from Beginner to Pro

Regular expressions (Regex) are a powerful tool for searching, validating, and manipulating text. Although they may seem complex at first glance, they are an indispensable tool for every PHP developer. In this article, I’ll show you how to effectively use Regex in PHP—from the basics to advanced techniques.

## 1. What is Regex?

Regular expressions (Regex) are a special syntax used to describe patterns in text. They are used in many programming languages, text editors, and tools to search, validate, or transform text.

### What is Regex used for?
- **Text Search**: Find specific patterns in text (e.g., all email addresses in a document).
- **Text Validation**: Check if a text matches a specific pattern (e.g., a valid phone number).
- **Text Replacement**: Replace parts of text based on a pattern (e.g., replace all URLs with hyperlinks).
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific information from text (e.g., all hashtags from a social media post).

### Why is Regex important?
Regex is a universal tool used in many areas of software development. It is particularly useful when working with text that contains complex patterns. Although Regex may seem complicated at first, learning the basics is worth it, as it can save you a lot of time and effort.

### Example: Simple Regex in PHP
```php
// Check if a string contains only letters
if (preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z]+$/", "HelloWorld")) {
    echo "Valid!";
} else {
    echo "Invalid!";
}
```

## 2. Regex Basics

### Character Classes
Character classes define a group of characters that can appear at a specific position in the text.
- `[a-z]`: Lowercase letters from a to z.
- `\d`: A digit (0–9).
- `\w`: A word character (letters, digits, or underscore).

Example:
```php
// Check if a string contains only letters
if (preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z]+$/", "HelloWorld")) {
    echo "Valid!";
}
```

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how often a character or character class may appear.
- `*`: Zero or more.
- `+`: One or more.
- `?`: Zero or one.
- `{n,m}`: Between n and m times.

Example:
```php
// Check if a string contains between 3 and 5 digits
if (preg_match("/^\d{3,5}$/", "1234")) {
    echo "Valid!";
}
```

### Grouping
Grouping allows you to combine parts of a pattern.
- `(abc)`: Groups the characters "abc".
- `a|b`: Either "a" or "b".

Example:
```php
// Check if a string contains "cat" or "dog"
if (preg_match("/(cat|dog)/", "I love cats!")) {
    echo "Match found!";
}
```

## 3. Advanced Techniques

### Lookaheads
Lookaheads allow you to search for patterns without including them in the result.
- `(?=...)`: Positive lookahead.
- `(?!...)`: Negative lookahead.

Example:
```php
// Password validation: At least 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 digit
if (preg_match("/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$/", "Secure123")) {
    echo "Strong password!";
}
```

### Named Groups
Named groups allow you to name parts of a pattern and reference them later.
- `(?<name>...)`: Names a group.

Example:
```php
// Extract date in YYYY-MM-DD format
if (preg_match("/(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/", "2025-01-05", $matches)) {
    echo "Year: " . $matches['year']; // Output: 2025
}
```

### Greedy vs. Lazy Quantifiers
- **Greedy**: The quantifier tries to match as much text as possible.
- **Lazy**: The quantifier tries to match as little text as possible.

Example:
```php
// Greedy vs. Lazy
$text = "abcabcabc";
preg_match("/a.*c/", $text, $greedy); // Matches "abcabcabc"
preg_match("/a.*?c/", $text, $lazy);  // Matches "abc"
```

## 4. Practical Applications

### Text Replacement
Use `preg_replace` to replace text.

Example:
```php
// Replace all vowels with "*"
$text = "Hello World!";
$result = preg_replace("/[aeiou]/i", "*", $text);
echo $result; // Output: H*ll* W*rld!
```

### Data Extraction
You can extract specific data from text.

Example:
```php
// Extract URLs from text
$text = "Visit https://example.com or http://test.org for more info.";
preg_match_all("/https?:\/\/[^\s]+/", $text, $matches);
print_r($matches[0]); // Output: Array of URLs
```

### Validation
Regex is excellent for validating user input.

Example:
```php
// Email validation
$email = "test@example.com";
if (preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/", $email)) {
    echo "Valid email!";
}
```

## 5. Performance Tips

Regex is powerful but can cause performance issues if used incorrectly. Here are some tips to ensure your Regex is efficient:

1. **Avoid Complex Regex**  
   - Problem: Very complex Regex patterns can be slow, especially with large texts.  
   - Solution: Break down complex patterns into simpler parts or use alternative methods (e.g., string functions like `strpos` or `str_replace`).

   Example:  
   Instead of:
   ```php
   preg_match("/^(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z)+$/", $text);
   ```  
   Better:
   ```php
   preg_match("/^[a-z]+$/i", $text);
   ```

2. **Use `preg_match_all` Sparingly**  
   - Problem: `preg_match_all` searches the entire text and can be slow with large texts.  
   - Solution: Use `preg_match` if you only need the first occurrence of a pattern.

   Example:  
   Instead of:
   ```php
   preg_match_all("/\d+/", $text, $matches);
   ```  
   Better (if only the first occurrence is needed):
   ```php
   preg_match("/\d+/", $text, $matches);
   ```

3. **Cache Results**  
   - Problem: Running the same Regex operation multiple times can impact performance.  
   - Solution: Store the results of Regex operations in variables or a database for reuse.

   Example:
   ```php
   $pattern = "/^[a-z]+$/i";
   $result = preg_match($pattern, $text);
   if ($result) {
       // Use the result
   }
   ```

4. **Use `preg_quote` for Dynamic Patterns**  
   - Problem: Including user input in Regex can lead to errors due to special characters.  
   - Solution: Use `preg_quote` to escape special characters.

   Example:
   ```php
   $userInput = "test.com";
   $pattern = "/^" . preg_quote($userInput, "/") . "$/";
   if (preg_match($pattern, "test.com")) {
       echo "Match!";
   }
   ```
